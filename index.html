                 <p>Frameworks actually do help with web development as they improve efficiency of coding and the development of websites and web applications. They ensure the easy debugging of errors, thus improving code quality and readability.They also ensure code reuasability as codebase are predefined.</p>  
                 <p>Despite the many benefits that frameworks produce, there are still drawbacks as they are not very suitable for learners as you dont get to fully comprehend certain concepts of a programming language. They also restrict personalisation and customability/</p>

                 <p>Git is a form of Version Control System, which allows users to collaborate with other developers on a project without affecting each others work and seeing previous versions. Git has been used by developers throughout as they allow developers to create multiple versions of projects and work in teams while always having access to their projects whenever and wherever they want, simply provided there is an internet access.</p>
                 <p> Github has also come out with Github pages which allows users to host there webpages/websites provided the repository is public. With this the user can create mock sites and access them. However, support for server side languages is currently not supported.</p>
